# Example 1.5 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §1)

Scott's fourth worked example: tokens `Δ = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and `𝒟` the family of **all non-empty
subsets** of `Δ`.

> This system is a direct generalization of Example 1.2 … The verification that the present `𝒟`
> is a neighbourhood system rests on nothing more than the remark that sets are consistent in `𝒟`
> iff they have a non-empty intersection.

We encode tokens as `Fin 4`, take `mem X := X.Nonempty`, and `master := Set.univ`. Condition (ii)
of Definition 1.1 is immediate: a consistency witness `Z ⊆ X ∩ Y` that is itself non-empty makes
`X ∩ Y` non-empty.

* **Example 1.5** — `neighborhoodSystem`.
* **Factoid 1.5a** — `consistent_iff_inter_nonempty`: a finite prefix is consistent in `𝒟` iff its
  intersection is non-empty (Scott's "remark").

Unlike Examples 1.2–1.4 this construction needs no `fin_cases`/`decide`: it is `Set.Nonempty`
bookkeeping, so it audits **constructive** (`[propext, Quot.sound]`).
