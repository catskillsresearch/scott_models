# Example 1.4 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §1)

Scott's third worked example: the **binary tree** of depth 2. Tokens are the finite binary
sequences of length ≤ 2, `Δ = {Λ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11}`, and the neighbourhoods are the
subtrees rooted at each node:

`𝒟 = {Δ, {0,00,01}, {1,10,11}, {00}, {01}, {10}, {11}}`.

We encode the seven tokens as `Fin 7`:

| token | `Λ` | `0` | `1` | `00` | `01` | `10` | `11` |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `Fin 7` | `0` | `1` | `2` | `3` | `4` | `5` | `6` |

so `left = {0,00,01} = {1,3,4}`, `right = {1,10,11} = {2,5,6}`, and the four leaves are the
singletons `{3}, {4}, {5}, {6}`.

We build the neighbourhood system (Definition 1.1) and classify its domain elements
(Definition 1.6): there are exactly **seven** filters. Unlike Example 1.3's linear chain, this is
the first example with **branching** — at the partial elements `elemZero`/`elemOne` one has a
*choice* of how to refine toward one of the four total (leaf) elements.

This is a concrete finite computation (`fin_cases`/`simp`); footprint
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — same as Examples 1.2/1.3.
