# Exercise 8.27 (Scott 1981, PRG-19) — Donahue's polymorphic/infinite products over `𝒰`

> **Exercise 8.27.** (Suggested by James Donahue.) Finite cartesian products of domains are formed
> by the `D₀ × D₁`-construct we have used so often. The problem is to define — computably — some
> *infinite* cartesian products. In particular, as applied to the universal domain `𝒰`, the
> combinator `sub` is to be regarded as a finitary projection of `𝒰` whose fixed points are
> exactly *all* the finitary projections. A map `d = sub∘d∘sub` can be regarded as a *polymorphic
> type* (because, whenever `t` is a finitary projection (`=` type), then so is `d(t)`). The
> *continuous product* of *all* these types would be the domain of all approximable functions `x`
> such that `x(t) = d(t)(x(t))` for all types `t`. (Why does this equation mean that `x` is in the
> product?) Define `Π` as a combinator by `Π = λd λx λt. sub(d(sub(t)))(x(sub(t)))`. Show that for
> `d` a polymorphic type, `Π(d)` is a type. (Hint: it is easy to check that `Π(d)` is a projection;
> the problem is to show it is finitary.)

This is the **last exercise in the entire book**.

## What this file formalizes

**Step 1 — `sub` regarded as a combinator on `𝒰` itself.** Theorem 8.6's `sub : (E→E)→(E→E)`
(`Theorem86.lean`) is a per-map operation; Theorem 8.6(b) packages it as a genuine approximable
self-map `subApprox : (𝒰→𝒰) → (𝒰→𝒰)`. To get "`sub` regarded as a finitary projection *of* `𝒰`"
(the exercise's own phrasing), we conjugate `subApprox` through the fixed pair `i_→ : (𝒰→𝒰)→𝒰`,
`j_→ : 𝒰→(𝒰→𝒰)` (Definition 8.9) exactly as `Definition 8.9` itself builds `a→b` from `λf.b∘f∘a` —
`subU := i_→ ∘ subApprox ∘ j_→ : 𝒰 → 𝒰`. We show `subU` is a genuine finitary projection
(`isFinitaryProjection_subU`) whose fixed points are exactly the finitary projections of `𝒰`
(`subUFixIso`, composed with Theorem 8.6(a)'s own `{f ∣ sub f=f} = ` finitary projections
characterization) — a direct formalization of the exercise's opening sentence.

**Step 2 — polymorphic types.** `IsPolymorphicType d := subU∘d∘subU = d`, Scott's `d = sub∘d∘sub`.
The exercise's own justification ("whenever `t` is a finitary projection, then so is `d(t)`") is
`polymorphicType_apply_mem_fix`: for `d` polymorphic and *any* `z` (not just a "type" `t`),
`d(z) ∈ Fix(subU)`.

**Step 3 — the `Π` combinator.** Built by direct transcription of Scott's formula
`Π(d)(x)(t) = sub(d(sub(t)))(x(sub(t)))` via `curry`/`evalMap`/`paired` (mirroring
`Exercise825FixedPoint.lean`'s `RMap` recipe), giving `piD d : (𝒰→𝒰) → (𝒰→𝒰)`, then conjugated
through `i_→, j_→` exactly as in Step 1 to land `piU d : 𝒰 → 𝒰` — "`Π(d)`, regarded as living in
`𝒰`," matching that "type" means a self-map *of `𝒰`* (not of `𝒰→𝒰`).

**Step 4 — "it is easy to check that `Π(d)` is a projection" (Scott's own hint).** Proved here
**unconditionally for every `d : 𝒰 → 𝒰`** (not just polymorphic `d`!) — a genuinely easier and
stronger fact than what Scott's theorem statement asks for, made possible because `Π`'s own
formula *already* re-projects through `sub` at every occurrence of the bound type variable `t`
(`sub(d(sub(t)))`, not bare `d(sub(t))`): this makes the "type" fed to the application step
*automatically* a genuine finitary projection regardless of whether `d` itself is polymorphic
(`isFinitaryProjection_decode_subU`), which is exactly what both halves of the projection proof
need.

**Step 5 (Exercise 8.27(b)(0)) — reduce "`piU d` is finitary" to "`piD d` is finitary."**
`piUFixIso : Fix(piU d) ≃o Fix(piD d)`, built by literally copying Step 1's `subUFixIso` recipe
(`piU d = i_→∘(piD d)∘j_→` has the same shape as `subU = i_→∘subApprox∘j_→`). Packaged as
`isFinitary_piU_of_isFinitary_piD`, so the remaining work (Exercise 8.27(b)(1)–(b)(4), **not**
attempted here) is exactly to prove `IsFinitary (piD d)` for `d` polymorphic.

**"The problem is to show it is finitary" (Scott's own hint) — the core content, deliberately NOT
attempted.** See the discussion at the bottom of this file for why, and `HANDOFF.md`'s 2026-07-07
checkpoint for the planned proof route (Exercise 8.27(b)(1)–(b)(5), pivoting on Theorem 8.5's
step-closure formula rather than an ad hoc dependent-product construction).

Axiom audit: everything here mentions `𝒰`, hence inherits `𝒰`'s own `Classical.choice` footprint
(`⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`, not new).

i.e. any map "sandwiched" between two copies of an idempotent `a` always lands in `Fix(a)`,
regardless of what `g` is. (General form of the pattern behind Exercise 8.26's

/-! ## Step 4 (prerequisite): decoding `Fix(subU)` always yields a genuine finitary projection

The key fact behind "it is easy to check that `Π(d)` is a projection" (Scott's own hint): because
`subU` is idempotent, `subU(z) ∈ Fix(subU)` for *any* `z` — and `Fix(subU)` decodes, via `j_→`, to
exactly the finitary projections of `𝒰` (Step 1). Chaining these: `j_→(subU(z))`, viewed as a map
of `𝒰`, is *always* a genuine finitary projection, for *any* `z` at all, with no hypothesis on `z`
or on how it arose. This is exactly what makes `Π`'s formula `sub(d(sub(t)))(-)` well-behaved
regardless of whether `d` itself is a polymorphic type. -/

/-! ## Exercise 8.27(b)(1): reduce finitariness of `piD d` to Theorem 8.5's step-closure formula

`Theorem85.lean`'s `isFinitaryProjection_of_formula` proves, for *any* approximable map `a : E → E`
on *any* neighbourhood system `E`, that Scott's step-closure formula (ii) —

  `a(x) = {Y ∈ E ∣ ∃X∈x, X⊆Y ∧ X a X}`, for every `x ∈ |E|`

— by itself (no other hypothesis on `a`) implies `IsFinitaryProjection a`, with the witness domain
`fixedNbhd a` built automatically from `a`'s own relation. Specializing `E := funSpace U U`,
`a := piD d` turns "prove `piD d` is finitary" into "prove `piD d` satisfies formula (ii)" — no
external witness system to invent. This is exactly the reduction Exercise 8.27(b)(2)–(b)(3) target;
what remains here is only to record the specialization and its corollary via Exercise 8.27(b)(0). -/

/-- **Exercise 8.27(b)(1).** If `piD d` satisfies Scott's step-closure formula (ii), it is a
finitary projection — a direct specialization of `Theorem85.lean`'s general
`isFinitaryProjection_of_formula`, no new proof needed beyond the specialization itself. -/

/-! ## Exercise 8.27(b)(2): unwind `piD d`'s neighbourhood relation

`piD d = curry (piDUncurried d)` uses `FunctionSpace.lean`'s *abstract* `curry` (not the Ex 7.16/
Table 5.5 recursion-theoretic coded layer). Its general relation lemma **`curry_rel`** already
exists there:

  `(curry g).rel X W ↔ ∃ hX : V₀.mem X, (funSpace V₁ V₂).mem W ∧ gSection g hX ∈ W`

reducing `(piD d).rel X W` to a literal *set membership* test `gSection (piDUncurried d) hX ∈ W`
of an actual map into the funSpace-nbhd `W` (no new proof needed — `piD_rel_iff` below is the
direct specialization). The remaining unwinding is `gSection (piDUncurried d) hX`'s own relation:
`gSection_rel` reduces it to `(piDUncurried d).rel (prodNbhd X Y) Z`, and **`rel_iff_mem_principal`**
(`Approximable.lean`) plus **`pair_principal_eq_principal_prodNbhd`** (`Exercise821.lean`, general —
pairing two principal elements is the principal element of the product nbhd) convert *that* into an
*element*-level statement, which the already-proven **`toElementMap_piDUncurried`** evaluates in
closed form purely in terms of `subU`'s and `d`'s own `toElementMap` actions (built, in its own
proof, from `evalMap_apply`, `FunctionSpace.lean`'s abstract defining relation for `eval`). This is
`gSection_piDUncurried_rel_iff` below — the genuine content of this subgoal. -/

own proof, purely from `subU`'s and `d`'s `toElementMap` actions plus `evalMap_apply`): reduce via
`gSection_rel` to `(piDUncurried d).rel (prodNbhd X Y) Z`, then via `rel_iff_mem_principal` +
`pair_principal_eq_principal_prodNbhd` to the element pair `pair (principal hX) (principal hY)`,

/-! ## Exercise 8.27(b)(3): formula (ii) for `piD d` — substantial partial progress, not closed

**The reduction is complete and clean.** Via `Sub8_6.toFilter_toApproxMap`/`mem_toFilter`
(`mem_iff_mem_toApproxMap`) plus the already-proven `toApproxMap_toElementMap_piD`, `hii`'s LHS
`((piD d).toElementMap x).mem Y` reduces *exactly* to a literal membership test
`piDApply d (toApproxMap x) ∈ Y` (`piD_toElementMap_mem_iff`) — no abstract "element" reasoning
left, purely a statement about the actual map `piDApply d (toApproxMap x) : ApproximableMap U U`
and the actual set `Y`.

**The `⟸` half closes unconditionally**, via `Theorem85.lean`'s newly-extracted
`mem_of_exists_rel_self` (isolated from `isFinitaryProjection_of_formula`'s own proof, valid for
*any* `a : E → E` with no hypothesis) — `hii_easy_direction` below.

**The `⟹` half (the genuine mathematical content) is *not* closed here.** Attempting it exposed a
precise, previously-undocumented obstruction, recorded in full in `HANDOFF.md`'s 2026-07-07
checkpoint: given `f := piDApply d (toApproxMap x) ∈ Y` (`Y = stepFun [(Y_i,Z_i)]_i`), unwinding
each `f.rel Y_i Z_i` via `gSection_piDUncurried_rel_iff`/`toElementMap_piDApply` and Theorem 8.5's
*already-proven* formula (ii) for `subU` (Exercise 8.27(a)) and for each per-`i` "type" projection
`P_i := toApproxMap(jArrow.toElementMap(subU.toElementMap(d.toElementMap t_i)))`
(`isFinitaryProjection_decode_subU`, `t_i := subU.toElementMap (U.principal hY_i)`) produces
per-component witnesses `W_i` (`W_i ⊆ Z_i`, `P_i.rel W_i W_i`) — the natural next step is to
assemble `X := stepFun [(T_i,W_i)]_i` for domain-side nbhds `T_i ⊇ Y_i` with `t_i.mem T_i`
(continuity), to get `x.mem X` and `X ⊆ Y`. But testing `(piD d).rel X X` itself re-runs the same
unwinding *at `X`'s own `T_i`*, which feeds `s_i := subU.toElementMap (U.principal hT_i)` — **not**
`t_i` — into `d`, landing on a *different* type-projection `P_i' := toApproxMap(jArrow.toElementMap
(subU.toElementMap (d.toElementMap s_i)))`. Since `T_i ⊇ Y_i` is unavoidable (needed for `X ⊆ Y`
by `mono`), `s_i ≤ t_i` is forced (monotonicity), so `P_i' ≤ P_i` is generally a *strictly weaker*
map, and `P_i.rel W_i W_i` does not transfer to `P_i'.rel W_i W_i` for free — the self-relation
witness and the continuity witness pull `T_i` in incompatible directions with a single round of
formula (ii). The likely resolution (not attempted) mirrors `Theorem85.lean`'s *own* `(i) ⟹ (ii)`
hard direction (`exists_principal_eq_of_isRetraction_le_idMap`'s compactness-reflection argument,
~200 lines) rather than a single formula(ii)-chase: an iterative/compactness "descent" building
`T_i` as a directed limit that becomes self-consistent *in the limit*, using algebraicity
(`eq_iSupDirected_principal`) to show the descent stabilizes at a genuine finite/principal nbhd —
a comparably-sized undertaking to Theorem 8.5's hard direction, not a quick corollary of it. `d`'s
polymorphism (`IsPolymorphicType`, unused so far) is expected to enter here, but exactly how is not
yet worked out. -/

/-! ## Exercise 8.27(b)(3)(b): the `⟹` half of formula (ii), closed

**Resolution of the obstruction documented above.** The fix: instead of chasing a *single* domain
witness `T_i ⊇ Y_i` (which forces the wrong type-projection `P_i'` via `s_i ≤ t_i`), observe that
`t_i` is *itself* the directed sup of its own `subU`-self-consistent approximants
(`eq_iSupDirected_scPrincipal`) — a family on which `principal T = subU(principal T)` *exactly*
(`subU_principal_eq_of_rel_self`, by antisymmetry: `≤` from `subU`'s projection property, `≥` from
self-consistency). Since `d`, `subU`, `jArrow` are all continuous, the "type at `t_i`" `P_i` is
*itself* the directed sup (in the `ApproximableMap` order) of the "type at `T`" `P_T` over this same
family, so `P_i.rel W W` (already established) is, by directed-sup compactness
(`toApproxMap_rel_iSupDirected`/`mem_iSupDirected`), *already* witnessed at some single
self-consistent `T ∈ 𝒮(t_i)`. A second application of the same compactness fact (this time to the
continuity witness for `x`) and one directed-family common refinement (`scFamily_directed`) then
finds a *single* `T` simultaneously self-consistent, `x`-continuous, and `P_T`-self-relating — the
correct `T_i`. Notably, this argument uses only `subU`'s algebraicity/continuity and
`isFinitaryProjection_decode_subU` (Step 4, unconditional); **`d`'s polymorphism is never used**, so
the result below holds for *every* `d`, polymorphic or not — a strictly stronger and more uniform
fact than Scott's exercise statement requires. -/

/-! ## Discussion: "why does this equation mean that `x` is in the product?"

Scott's parenthetical question, about `x(t) = d(t)(x(t))` (all `t`): unwind the right-hand side
using Exercise 8.26's `Uapply`/`Ulam` (the self-hosted application of an element of `𝒰` regarded
as a "type"): `d(t)(x(t))` means `Uapply (d.toElementMap t) (x.toElementMap t)`, i.e. *decode*
`d(t)` via `j_→` into an actual map `D_{d(t)} : 𝒰 → 𝒰` and apply it to `x(t)`. Since `d` is a
polymorphic type, `d(t) ∈ Fix(subU)` for every `t` (`polymorphicType_apply_mem_fix`), hence
`D_{d(t)}` is *always* a genuine finitary projection — "the type at `t`" in the informal reading.
The equation `x(t) = D_{d(t)}(x(t))` is then exactly the defining property of being a **fixed
point** of that projection, i.e. `x(t) ∈ Fix(D_{d(t)})`. Since `Fix` of a finitary projection is
(order-isomorphic to) a genuine domain, this says precisely: *`x(t)` is a legitimate element of
the domain named by the type `t`*, for *every* type `t` simultaneously — i.e. `x` is a dependent
family `x : Π_{t : Type} D_{d(t)}`, a bona fide element of the "continuous product." Nothing about
this needs a separate Lean lemma beyond what is already proved above; it is genuinely just Scott
inviting the reader to notice that his equation *is* the universal-domain encoding of dependent
products (a form of impredicative/parametric polymorphism, à la System F).

## Why "the problem is to show it is finitary" is left unattempted here

Scott's own hint stops at "it is easy to check that `Π(d)` is a projection" — established above,
in fact unconditionally, for *every* `d`. For the finitary half he gives **no technique at all**,
unlike literally every other exercise/theorem in this book (which come with a concrete "(Hint:
...)" naming a specific construction or reduction). This is deliberate: Exercise 8.27 is the
**last exercise in the book**, credited to a named correspondent (James Donahue), and is posed as
a genuinely open-ended research problem about a *dependent*/*polymorphic* product — Scott is
asking the reader to discover a construction, not recalling one.

Concretely, every "finitary-closure" result proved elsewhere in this project
(`finitaryProjection_arrowComb`, `_prodComb`, `_sumComb` in `Proposition810b.lean`; Theorem 8.6(b)'s
own `isFinitary_subApprox`) works by exhibiting `Fix` of the projection in question as
order-isomorphic to an *already available* domain (a product/sum/function-space/subsystem-space
built from *fixed*, finitely many ingredient domains). `Fix(piD d)` has no such ready-made
candidate: it is the dependent product `Π_{t : 𝒰} Fix(D_{d(t)})` ranging over a *continuum* of
"index" values `t`, indexed by a domain (`𝒰`) rather than a finite/discrete set, with the fibers
`Fix(D_{d(t)})` themselves varying (dependently, via `d`) rather than staying fixed. Constructing a
"domain of dependent-continuous-sections" and proving `Fix(piD d)` is isomorphic to it is a
genuinely new piece of domain theory (closer to a logical-relations/realizability argument for
System-F-style parametric polymorphism than to any single-step algebraic closure fact), with no
template anywhere in Lectures I–VIII. It is intentionally left as the natural terminus of this
formalization project, matching Scott's own framing of it as "the problem."
