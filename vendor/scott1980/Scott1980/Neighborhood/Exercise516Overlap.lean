# Exercise 5.16 follow-up (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture V) — overlap-freeness of `t`

The second Thue–Morse property Scott asks for: `t` is **overlap-free**, `t ≠ u·a·a·a·v` for any
finite `u` and nonempty `a`. This is a self-contained theorem of combinatorics on words (Thue 1912);
it uses **no domain theory** (only the parity recurrences `tm (2n) = tm n`, `tm (2n+1) = ¬ tm n` of
the bit-function `tm` from `Exercise516ThueMorse`) and has no leverage from Mathlib, so it is proved
from scratch here.

We phrase an **overlap** of period `p ≥ 1` at offset `i` as a factor of length `2p+1` with period
`p`: `Overlap i p := 1 ≤ p ∧ ∀ k ≤ p, tm (i+k) = tm (i+p+k)`. The main theorem `no_overlap` shows no
overlap exists, and `overlap_free` is Scott's literal cube form `t ≠ u·a·a·a·v` (an overlap is
weaker than a cube, so the cube form follows).

The proof is the classical descent: the two base facts are *no three consecutive equal symbols*
(`no_three_consec`, the period-1 case) and a direct period-3 computation; an even period `2q`
contracts to a period-`q` overlap via the substitution structure, and an odd period `≥ 5` forces a
run of three equal symbols.

  rw [tm_two_mul, tm_two_mul_add_one]

/-- `tm x = tm (x+1)` forces `x` to be **odd**: equal consecutive symbols only straddle a block
boundary `(2m+1, 2m+2)`, never a block `(2m, 2m+1)`. -/

/-- **No three consecutive equal symbols** (the period-`1` case): `¬ (tm j = tm (j+1) ∧
tm (j+1) = tm (j+2))`. If both held, `j` and `j+1` would both be odd. -/
