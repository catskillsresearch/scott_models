# Exercise 4.12 (Scott 1981, PRG-19, Lecture IV)

*Need an approximable `f : 𝒟 → 𝒟` have a **maximum** fixed point? Give an example where there are
many fixed points.*

**No.** The identity map `I_𝒟` has *every* element as a fixed point. Taking `𝒟` to be Scott's
Example 1.2 (the fork `T` with `⊥ ⊏ {0}-total`, `⊥ ⊏ {1}-total` and the two total elements
incomparable), `I_T` has three fixed points `⊥`, `elemZero`, `elemOne`; the two total ones are
maximal and incomparable, so there is **no greatest fixed point** (`no_greatest_fixedPoint`) — in
particular no maximum. This is the simplest counterexample to "a least fixed point is a maximum
fixed point".

Uses `Classical.choice` only through Example 1.2's finite `fin_cases`/`simp` classification, exactly
as that file does.
