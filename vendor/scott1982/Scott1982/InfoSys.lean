# Scott Information Systems

Following Dana Scott, *"Domains for Denotational Semantics"* (ICALP 1982) and the
compact presentation in Glynn Winskel, *The Formal Semantics of Programming
Languages*, Chapter 8.

Following Scott's **Definition 2.1**, an information system is a structure
`(P, Δ, Con, ⊢)` where

* `P` is a set of *data objects* / *propositions* (our token type `α`);
* `Δ ∈ P` is a distinguished *least informative* object (here the field `bot`);
* `Con` is a set of finite subsets of `P`, the *consistent* sets; and
* `⊢` (entailment, here `Ent`) relates a finite set to a token it forces.

Scott's six axioms (Def. 2.1) are, for finite `u, v ⊆ P` and `X ∈ P`:

* (i)   `u ∈ Con` whenever `u ⊆ v ∈ Con`              — `con_subset`
* (ii)  `{X} ∈ Con`                                    — `con_sing`
* (iii) `u ∪ {X} ∈ Con` whenever `u ⊢ X`               — `ent_con`
* (iv)  `u ⊢ Δ`                                         — `ent_bot`
* (v)   `u ⊢ X` whenever `X ∈ u`                        — `ent_refl`
* (vi)  if `v ⊢ Y` for all `Y ∈ u` and `u ⊢ X` then `v ⊢ X` — `ent_trans`

The **domain** determined by an information system is the poset of its *elements*
(a.k.a. *ideals*): sets of tokens that are consistent on every finite subset and
closed under entailment, ordered by inclusion. This file sets up the structure, the
notion of element, and the partial order; later files build the function, product,
and sum spaces.

This is the **1982** presentation; the development is kept choice-free (constructive),
matching Scott's emphasis on the constructive nature of the definitions.

/-- A Scott information system on a type of tokens `α`, following Scott's Definition 2.1
in *"Domains for Denotational Semantics"* (ICALP 1982).

`DecidableEq α` is required so that finite token sets support union (`X ∪ {a}`) and the
other `Finset` operations the axioms mention. -/
structure InfoSys (α : Type*) [DecidableEq α] where
  /-- The distinguished least-informative object `Δ`. -/
  bot : α
  /-- The consistent finite sets of tokens. -/
  Con : Set (Finset α)
  /-- Entailment: `Ent u a` means the consistent set `u` forces the token `a`. -/
  Ent : Finset α → α → Prop
  /-- (i) Consistency is downward closed under `⊆`. -/
  con_subset : ∀ {u v : Finset α}, u ∈ Con → v ⊆ u → v ∈ Con
  /-- (ii) Every singleton is consistent. -/
  con_sing : ∀ a : α, {a} ∈ Con
  /-- (iii) A set entailing `a` stays consistent when `a` is added. Scott writes this as
  `u ∪ {a} ∈ Con`; we use the definitionally identical `insert a u`, because mathlib's
  `Finset` union instance (unlike `insert`) depends on `Classical.choice`, which would
  break the constructive development. -/
  ent_con : ∀ {u : Finset α} {a : α}, Ent u a → insert a u ∈ Con
  /-- (iv) The least token `Δ` is entailed by every consistent set. -/
  ent_bot : ∀ {u : Finset α}, u ∈ Con → Ent u bot
  /-- (v) Entailment is reflexive on members of a consistent set. -/
  ent_refl : ∀ {u : Finset α} {a : α}, u ∈ Con → a ∈ u → Ent u a
  /-- (vi) Entailment is transitive (cut): if a consistent `v` entails every member of a
  consistent `u`, and `u ⊢ c`, then `v ⊢ c`. -/
  ent_trans : ∀ {u v : Finset α} {c : α},
    v ∈ Con → u ∈ Con → (∀ y ∈ u, Ent v y) → Ent u c → Ent v c
