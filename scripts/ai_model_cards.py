- **Dana Scott** — *Continuous Lattices* **[Sco72]**, *Lectures on a Mathematical Theory of
  Computation* (PRG-19) **[Sco81]**, and *Domains for Denotational Semantics* **[Sco82]**, the
  three presentations this development relates.

### AI-assisted development

The human author retains sole responsibility for the mathematical content, the choice of
formalization route, and every formal claim in this work. Following standard publisher practice
(e.g., COPE guidance on authorship and AI tools **[COPE24]**), **no large language model is listed
as a co-author** — authorship implies an accountability that automated systems cannot bear.

Because this development may borrow Lean and proof patterns from the sibling formalizations
[`scott1972`](https://github.com/catskillsresearch/scott1972) **[SR72]**,
[`scott1980`](https://github.com/catskillsresearch/scott1980) **[ER80]**, and
[`scott1982`](https://github.com/catskillsresearch/scott1982) **[SR82]**, **every model in the
registry is treated as used** for acknowledgement purposes. We gratefully acknowledge assistance
from the following tools (auto-generated from `scripts/ai_model_cards.py` when building
`arxiv.tex`):

<!-- AI_MODEL_TOOL_BULLETS -->
<!-- /AI_MODEL_TOOL_BULLETS -->

All definitions, constructivity audits, and final prose were reviewed by the human author, who takes
full responsibility for them.

### Artifact availability and reproducibility

The development is at
[`github.com/catskillsresearch/scott_models`](https://github.com/catskillsresearch/scott_models).
GitHub Actions CI checks out the three sibling packages as path dependencies and runs
`lake build`; the library builds successfully on `main` (green status).

Locally:

```bash
lake exe cache get
lake build ScottModels
```

Sibling packages `scott1972`, `scott1980`, `scott1982` are Lake path dependencies
(`lakefile.toml`). Session state lives in `HANDOFF.md`; `arxiv.md` is the durable inventory
and proof narrative. Axiom audits: `#print axioms` on the blueprint-facing names
(`presentation_domains_equiv`, `infoSys_product_domain_equiv`,
`approximableMap_scottContinuous_equiv`, `scottMap_roundInfoSys_iso`, …).

Build the arXiv PDF / submission zip (Lean Code appendix = GitHub hyperlinks):

```bash
bash scripts/build_arxiv_tex.sh      # arxiv.md → arxiv.tex + figures/
bash scripts/build_arxiv_pdf.sh      # compile PDF + package dist/arxiv_submit.zip
# or: bash scripts/package_arxiv_submit.sh
```
